## About The Project

**Project Title:**

Rick and Morty Explorer: Exploring the Universe with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Description:**

The "Rick and Morty Explorer" project is a web application created to develop and demonstrate skills in using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application leverages the Rick and Morty API to explore the vast universe of the popular animated series "Rick and Morty".

**Features:**

- **Character Exploration:** Users can navigate through a wide range of characters from the series, viewing their key information such as name, status, species, and gender.
  
- **Intuitive Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to quickly find the desired information about the characters.
  
- **Interactive Experience:** Users can interact with the application by clicking buttons and selecting options to filter and display specific categories of characters, such as those alive, dead, or of a specific species.

**Learning Objectives:**

- **Front-end Development:** Using HTML to structure content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive logic.
  
- **API Handling:** Making API calls to retrieve and display dynamic data within the application.
  
- **Data Manipulation:** Processing and presenting data obtained from the API effectively and understandably for the user.

**Purpose:**

The "Rick and Morty Explorer" project serves as a demonstration of the skills acquired in front-end web development and integration of external APIs. Through this project, developers can showcase their ability to create interactive and engaging experiences using core web technologies.
