Variable Declarations:
image, status, name, race, gender, card, buttons, content, CardSelector, Section3H1: These variables store references to various elements in the HTML document using document.querySelector() or document.querySelectorAll().
Button Click Event Listeners:
This block of code adds event listeners to all buttons with the class .Buttons. When a button is clicked, it triggers a function that adds fade-in and fade-out animations to certain elements, fetches character data based on the button's data attribute, and calls the CharCard() function to display character cards.
Asynchronous Functions:
getCharactersByStatus(status): This function fetches character data from the Rick and Morty API based on the character's status (alive, dead, or unknown).
getAllCharacters(): This function fetches all character data from the Rick and Morty API by iterating through all pages of the API's paginated response.
CharCard() Function:
This function populates the character cards with data retrieved from the API. It randomly selects a character from the fetched data, sets the background image of the card, and displays the character's status, name, race, and gender. It also adds a click event listener to each card that triggers the showModale() function when clicked.
showCards() Function:
This function displays all character cards on the page and hides other elements like headings and buttons associated with the card section.
showModale(character) Function:
This function displays a modal containing detailed information about a character when a card is clicked. It sets the character's location, episode, and image in the modal. If the character has multiple episodes, it only displays the first episode.
closeModale() Function:
This function closes the modal by hiding it and clearing any text content that might have been previously set.
